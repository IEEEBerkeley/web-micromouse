# Course Information
<b>Contact</b>: micromouse@ieee.berkeley.edu

The UC Berkeley IEEE Student Branch’s Micromouse DeCal is a hands-on course aimed at undergraduates with an interest in robotics. In the class, teams of ~2 students are formed to build and program autonomous, maze-solving cars that follow the standards set in IEEE’s Micromouse competition.

The course assumes no experience and will be based around a series of labs and project milestones that cover a wide range of robotics concepts. The course will expose students to CircuitPython programming, autonomous navigation, sensors, PID, and basic electrical engineering.

This is a prerequisite free DeCal, we assume no prior knowledge. In this course you will learn how to solder (both through hole and SMD) and how to program on a microcontroller using python. Ultimately applying these skills to put together an autonomous maze solving mouse Each group is provided a PCB and components free of charge. You will spend the first few sessions of the semester assembling your mouse. Afterwards we will move onto programming the mouse, programming labs can typically be completed within the two hour time slot of our sessions. You may take your mouse home to work on it if you find yourself wanting more time.

We will have weekly 2 hour long sessions. We may hold office hours / workshops depending on how the course is progressing. The first 20-30 minutes or so of the weekly sessions should be a primer on that week’s content, the lab documentation will expand on the content covered during lecture. Students will be checked off when they complete each lab.

There will be no exams, your grade will be primarily determined by the completion of your mouse as well as attending the majority of our session. Please contact any of the instructors using the micromouse email, or you can find our information on the staff page of the website. DeCals are for your enjoyment and you will get much more out of them if you attend every session. If you have any questions regarding your standing please reach out to a staff member.


All necessary parts will be provided to students at no cost.

Interested in joining us next semester? Be on the lookout for us on the decal page 

### Prerequisites
The Micromouse Discord is live:http://berkie.ee/micromouse-discord
There are no formal class prerequisites, we will teach you all that you will need to know in order to successfully assemble and program your mouse :)


## Grading

Grading (pass / no pass) will primarily be determined by your attendance and lab checkoffs, deCals are for your enjoyment and you will get much more out of them if you attend every session.If you have any questions regarding your standing please reach out to a staff member.
